# Football Manager 2024 Player Transfer Valuation Analysis

# Project Status: ONGOING

## Introduction
This project models player value within Football Manager 2024, based on a number of features, including all of their attributes, as well as other features such as the league they play in and their age.

This project involved data engineering and manipulation using Pandas, and then an extensive use of plotting libraries such as maplotlib and seaborn to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

scikit-learn was then used to perform the modelling, linear regression and XGBoost models were used in this project.

## Technologies

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn


## Conclusions

This model shows good predictive performance, still with areas to improve upon.

The insights that this project provides were that Age and Wage were the most powerful predictors of a player's value, with their league and nationality being the least powerful.

Acceleration was the most important attribute feature, and Flair was the least. There are more developed insights I have provided in the Model Evaluation section of the notebook if you are interested to read more.
